# Drinking Behavior Prediction using Machine Learning

This repository contains the code and documentation for predicting drinking behavior using machine learning techniques. The project leverages a dataset with various physical parameters to understand the factors influencing alcohol consumption.

## Project Overview

This project aims to predict alcohol consumption by analyzing a dataset with various physical parameters. The key steps involved are:

1. Literature Review and Hypothesis Formation
2. Pattern Research and Data Analysis
3. Data Preprocessing and Feature Selection
4. Model Training and Validation

## Motivation

By using machine learning to predict alcohol consumption based on specific physical parameters, we can gain a deeper understanding of the factors influencing alcohol consumption behavior. This knowledge can become the basis for targeted interventions and policies aimed at mitigating the negative effects of alcohol abuse.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is collected from the National Health Insurance Service in Korea. It includes a range of physical parameters related to individuals' health.

## Features Analyzed

### Parameters affected by drinking alcohol:
- Diastolic BP
- Fasting Blood Glucose
- HDL Cholesterol
- LDL Cholesterol
- Triglycerides
- Gamma GTP
- Serum Creatinine
- Hearing

### Parameters not affected by drinking alcohol:
- Systolic BP (disproved)
- SGOT(AST) (disproved)
- SGOT(ALT) (disproved)
- Protein in Urine (disproved)
- Height (disproved)
- Weight (disproved)

## Methods

1. **Literature Review and Hypothesis Formation:** Conducted a comprehensive review of existing literature to formulate hypotheses about parameters affected by alcohol consumption.
2. **Pattern Research and Data Analysis:** Analyzed patterns and dependencies within the dataset to understand the relationships between physical parameters and drinking behavior.
3. **Data Preprocessing and Feature Selection:** Performed preprocessing steps such as handling missing data and feature selection using backward feature elimination.
4. **Model Training and Validation:** Trained and validated multiple machine learning models including Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and XGBoost.

### Model Performance

- **Random Forest**
  - Validation Accuracy: 72.85%
  - Test Accuracy: 72.77%

- **KNN**
  - Validation Accuracy: 69.57%
  - Test Accuracy: 69.88%

- **XGBoost**
  - Validation Accuracy: 73.29%
  - Test Accuracy: 73.22%
